abstract: "In many markets, consumers participate in costly search among alternative options before making a purchase. The way choices are presented to consumers impacts their search behavior and hence market competition and performance. The search intermediaries use consumers’ personal preferences data to provide personalized advice to consumers on what products to explore first. The paper studies how the market outcomes change with the information the search intermediary has.

I constructed the general equilibrium model of optimal firms’ pricing and optimal consumer choice with the search frictions. To estimate the model I utilize a rich dataset provided by Expedia, which includes consumers searching and purchase data as well as information on the hotels which consumers observe after filling a search query. Using estimation results I run simulations to evaluate the change in market outcomes under different data usage allowance policies.

I found that if the platform uses consumers’ personal preferences data to pro- vide a ranking of products, it has a heterogeneous effect on firms’ optimal pricing, depending on the degree of product vertical differentiation, while the average trans- action price increases. Consumers in average experience 3.1% ($4.2) utility reduction due to increased prices and .8% ($1.1) gain due to a reduction in search intensity."

summary: In many markets, consumers participate in costly search among alternative options before making a purchase. The way choices are presented to consumers impacts their search behavior and hence market competition and performance. The search intermediaries use consumers’ personal preferences data to provide personalized advice to consumers on what products to explore first. The paper studies how the market outcomes change with the information the search intermediary has.

I constructed the general equilibrium model of optimal firms’ pricing and optimal consumer choice with the search frictions. To estimate the model I utilize a rich dataset provided by Expedia, which includes consumers searching and purchase data as well as information on the hotels which consumers observe after filling a search query. Using estimation results I run simulations to evaluate the change in market outcomes under different data usage allowance policies.

I found that if the platform uses consumers’ personal preferences data to pro- vide a ranking of products, it has a heterogeneous effect on firms’ optimal pricing, depending on the degree of product vertical differentiation, while the average trans- action price increases. Consumers in average experience 3.1% ($4.2) utility reduction due to increased prices and .8% ($1.1) gain due to a reduction in search intensity.
