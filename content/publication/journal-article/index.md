abstract: The paper discusses markets with consumer’s search frictions and a partially informed intermediary. The main finding is the better information the platform has about consumers’ preferences can lead to decreasing in the average quality of the product consumers leave the market with, as well as decline in the total economic welfare and consumer surplus. The intuition behind the mechanism is if the platform has better information and makes better advise to consumers what product to explore first, consumers have lower expectations about the next products and explore them less often, which might lead to shrinking of the consideration set and as a result, the quality of a chosen product. The effect appears in the case of low search cost, which makes it especially important in the analysis of online search platforms.

summary: The paper discusses markets with consumer’s search frictions and a partially informed intermediary. The main finding is the better information the platform has about consumers’ preferences can lead to decreasing in the average quality of the product consumers leave the market with, as well as decline in the total economic welfare and consumer surplus. The intuition behind the mechanism is if the platform has better information and makes better advise to consumers what product to explore first, consumers have lower expectations about the next products and explore them less often, which might lead to shrinking of the consideration set and as a result, the quality of a chosen product. The effect appears in the case of low search cost, which makes it especially important in the analysis of online search platforms.
