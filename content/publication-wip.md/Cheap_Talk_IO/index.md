abstract: In this paper, I have studied the information transmission of two-dimensional and two-sender cheap talk model where the set of receiver’s policies are exogenously restricted. I consider the case when two senders cannot commit do not collude. It is clear that in such assumptions there is no full information revealed equilibrium (FRE) because senders can collude to report any fake state. Then I adopt this model to the case of two sellers and one buyer who is not sure which the quality of product she should buy. The main results of the paper are constructing of partial information revealed equilibrium (PRE) and proving this equilibrium still worse for all agents than FRE. Also I provide the estimation strategy to evaluate the seller’s biases. I use information of only sellers’ offers to the buyer and actual buying decision (what quality buyer bought) to evaluate the lower and the upper bounds of both sellers’ biases.

summary: In this paper, I have studied the information transmission of two-dimensional and two-sender cheap talk model where the set of receiver’s policies are exogenously restricted. I consider the case when two senders cannot commit do not collude. It is clear that in such assumptions there is no full information revealed equilibrium (FRE) because senders can collude to report any fake state. Then I adopt this model to the case of two sellers and one buyer who is not sure which the quality of product she should buy. The main results of the paper are constructing of partial information revealed equilibrium (PRE) and proving this equilibrium still worse for all agents than FRE. Also I provide the estimation strategy to evaluate the seller’s biases. I use information of only sellers’ offers to the buyer and actual buying decision (what quality buyer bought) to evaluate the lower and the upper bounds of both sellers’ biases.
