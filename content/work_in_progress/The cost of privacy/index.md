abstract: "The paper explores how the platform usage of data on consumers' personal preferences changes market welfare. Platforms like Google, Amazon, Expedia, etc. collect consumers' preferences data and use them to provide consumers better personal rankings of goods. For example, if you usually book a hotel of a certain chain, Expedia shows you this chain's hotels on higher positions on the list.
On the one hand, better product ranking, based on the consumer’s personal preferences helps consumers easier and faster search products which are reducing search expenditures. But on the other hand, the reduction in the search intensity provides higher market power to firms, which leads to higher prices. I analyze the net effect using a rich dataset of a searching and purchasing actions of consumers booking hotels on the Expedia site."
#I found that the net effect is positive and consumers' personal data usage restrictions are harmful to consumers and the whole economy.

#"The paper explores consumer switching between platforms in seeking access to the content provided by the platforms. The platforms manage consumer switching by providing access to the exclusive content not available on other platforms. The steering has a long-term effect, making consumers to stay on the new platform, even if they no longer have access to this exclusive content. Using rich and unique panel data from an internet service provider, I estimate the mechanism described above."

 #I investigate how better platforms ranking change market welfare. I found that the restrictions for platforms on the usage of consumers' personal data to provide better product ranking are harmful to consumers and the whole economy. That is due to two effects. On the one hand, better product ranking, based on the consumer’s personal preferences helps consumers easier and faster search products. Hence, consumers visit fewer firms, which increases consumer welfare by reducing search expenditures. But on the other hand, the reduction in the consumers’ search intensity provides higher market power to firms because consumers explore fewer products. This leads to higher prices and decreases consumers' welfare. I found that the net effect is positive and consumers' personal data usage restrictions are harmful to consumers and the whole economy.
