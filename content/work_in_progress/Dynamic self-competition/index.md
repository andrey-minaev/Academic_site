abstract: "I model dynamic self-competition, and test model predictions using the rich data of all shared rides in the City of Chicago in 2018-2020. Rideshare platforms face self-competition for drivers in neighbor locations and use surge-pricing to steer drivers to work in the area the platform needs. In turn, a price increase may force consumers to choose a competitor’s rideshare platform, and therefore affect cross-platform competition. Using data on local weather conditions as exogenous demand shifters, I study the interaction between self- and cross-platform competitions."

#I model dynamic self-competition and test model predictions using rich data of all shared rides in Chicago in 2018-2020. Rideshare platforms face self-competition for drivers over neighbor locations and use surge-pricing to steer drivers to work in the given area. Surging the price, in turn, makes consumers choose other platforms. Using high precise data of local weather conditions as exogenous demand shifters, I study the interaction between self- and inter-platform competitions.
