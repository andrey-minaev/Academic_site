abstract: I model consumers' switching between the platforms, finding access to the content provided by the platforms. Using rich and unique panel data from an internet service provider (ISP), I test predictions of the model. The platforms steer consumers switching by providing access to the exclusive content not available on other platforms. The steering has a long-term effect, making consumers stay with the new platform even when they do not get access to this exclusive content anymore.
