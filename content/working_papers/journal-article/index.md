abstract: I discuss a general equilibrium model of the market with differentiated consumers, firms and one mediator – the online platform. The platform sells to the firms online advertisement positions via Generalized Second Price Auction. These ads are the only way for the firms to attract consumers. Firms set goods’ prices and auction bids, and the subset of the firms with the highest bids are shown to the consumers. Consumers search costly with perfect recall for the best offer among the firms ranked by decreasing bids. I provide the necessary and sufficient condi- tions for the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium, solve for it, and discuss its properties. For all I know, this is the first study discusses the endogenous firms’ pricing behavior in such a setting.

summary: I discuss a general equilibrium model of the market with differentiated con- sumers, firms and one mediator – the online platform. The platform sells to the firms online advertisement positions via Generalized Second Price Auction. These ads are the only way for the firms to attract consumers. Firms set goods’ prices and auction bids, and the subset of the firms with the highest bids are shown to the consumers. Consumers search costly with perfect recall for the best offer among the firms ranked by decreasing bids. I provide the necessary and sufficient condi- tions for the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium, solve for it, and discuss its properties. For all I know, this is the first study discusses the endogenous firms’ pricing behavior in such a setting.
