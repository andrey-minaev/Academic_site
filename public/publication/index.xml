      <description>&lt;p&gt;In many markets, consumers search costly among alternative options before making a purchase. The way that choices are presented to consumers impacts their search behavior and hence competition and market performance. The search intermediaries use consumers’ personal preferences data to provide personalized advice to consumers on what products to explore first. The paper studies how the market outcomes change with the information the search intermediary has and whether the usage of such data should be restricted. I constructed the general equilibrium model of optimal consumer choice with the search frictions and optimal firms’ pricing. To estimate the model I utilize a rich dataset provided by Expedia, which includes consumers searching and purchase data as well as information on the hotels which consumers observe after filling a search query. Using estimation results I run simulations to evaluate the change in market outcomes under different data usage allowance policies.&lt;/p&gt;
