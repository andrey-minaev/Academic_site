      <description>&lt;p&gt;The paper explores how the platform usage of data on consumers&amp;rsquo; personal preferences changes market welfare. Platforms like Google, Amazon, Expedia, etc. collect consumers&amp;rsquo; preferences data and use them to provide consumers better personal rankings of goods. For example, if you usually book a hotel of a certain chain, Expedia shows you this chain&#39;s hotels on higher positions on the list.
On the one hand, better product ranking, based on the consumerâ€™s personal preferences helps consumers easier and faster search products which are reducing search expenditures. But on the other hand, the reduction in the search intensity provides higher market power to firms, which leads to higher prices. I analyze the net effect using a rich dataset of a searching and purchasing actions of consumers booking hotels on the Expedia site.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The paper shows that the entrance of new firms on ranking platforms with ordered consumer&#39;s search (e.g., Amazon and Google) can lead to an increase in the price charged by firms already presented on the market, despite increased market competition. The mechanism is as follows: an entrance of a new firm increases the chances of all other firms on the market to take low positions in the ranking, which, according to standard results of ordered search literature, leads to an increase in firms&amp;rsquo; prices.&lt;/p&gt;
