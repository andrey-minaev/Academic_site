      <title>Platform Switching: Steering of Consumers by Exclusive Content</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The paper explores consumer switching between platforms in seeking access to the content provided by the platforms. The platforms manage consumer switching by providing access to the exclusive content not available on other platforms. The steering has a long-term effect, making consumers to stay on the new platform, even if they no longer have access to this exclusive content. Using rich and unique panel data from an internet service provider, I estimate the mechanism described above.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dynamic self-competition: the evidence of rideshare platforms</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I model dynamic self-competition, and test model predictions using the rich data of all shared rides in the City of Chicago in 2018-2020. Rideshare platforms face self-competition for drivers in neighbor locations and use surge-pricing to steer drivers to work in the area the platform needs. In turn, a price increase may force consumers to choose a competitorâ€™s rideshare platform, and therefore affect cross-platform competition. Using data on local weather conditions as exogenous demand shifters, I study the interaction between self- and cross-platform competitions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Firms entrance on ranking platforms with ordered consumer search and firms&#39; market power.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The paper shows that the entrance of new firms on ranking platforms with ordered consumer&#39;s search (e.g., Amazon and Google) can lead to an increase in the price charged by firms already presented on the market, despite increased market competition. The mechanism is as follows: an entrance of a new firm increases the chances of all other firms on the market to take low positions in the ranking, which, according to standard results of ordered search literature, leads to an increase in firms&amp;rsquo; prices.&lt;/p&gt;
